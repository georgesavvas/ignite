> **Warning**<br>
> Ignite is still at an early stage in its development. Even though I will be working hard in ensuring its continued progression and offering as much support as I can, by using the software you acknowledge there might be workflow-breaking bugs that might require you to stop using it.
> Any support you can give, from reporting errors and crashes to development/code advice, will be greatly appreciated. You can either use the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2HWQduERrJ) or [Github Discussions](https://github.com/georgesavvas/ignite/discussions) to get in touch, or an email to george@ignitevfx.co.uk

# Summary
Ignite is a VFX pipeline solution aimed at freelancers running jobs from home. Its purpose is to offer studio-like tools that take away the complexities of managing the project file structure and naming conventions without requiring any technical knowledge to set up.

# Installation
Download and run the installer from the Releases section on the right.

# Developers

Ignite requires the **ignite_server** and **ignite_client** to function. During development you are required to start those manually from `backend/src/bin/[PLATFORM]`.

To launch the UI head inside `frontend` and run `npm start` for the auto-reload development server and `npm run electron` for the app.

# Supported Platforms
Currently only Windows is supported. OSX support is in development and Linux is to follow!
