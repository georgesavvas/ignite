> **Warning**
> Ignite is still at an early stage in its development. Even though I will be working hard in ensuring its continued progression and offering as much support as I can, by using the software you acknowledge there might be workflow-breaking bugs that might require you to stop using it.

# Summary
Ignite is a VFX pipeline solution aimed at freelancers running projects at home. Its purpose is to take away the complexities of managing the project file structure and path/naming conventions.

# Developers

Ignite requires the **ignite_server** and **ignite_client** to function. During development you are required to start those manually from `backend/src/bin/[PLATFORM]`.

To launch the UI head inside `frontend` and run `npm start` for the auto-reload development server and `npm run electron` for the app.

# Installation
Download and run the appropriate installer for your platform from the Releases section on the right.

# Supported Platforms
Currently supported platforms are Windows and OSX. Linux support is in the works!
