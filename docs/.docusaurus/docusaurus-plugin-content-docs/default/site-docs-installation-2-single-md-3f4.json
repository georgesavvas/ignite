  "description": "Once Ignite is installed and launched, it will prompt you for a projects directory. This is where your Ignite-managed projects will live in. Even though an ignite project is simply a directory tree, each directory contains useful metadata that tells Ignite how to traverse the project and how to treat each level. As such it is advised you choose an empty directory and either create projects from scratch or recreate existing ones by copying over your scenes and assets. A tool to assist with the migration of existing non Ignite projects is in concept stage.",
